    <p>if we want to write our tag as it is in our code then we can replace less than bracket with "&lt;" and grater than bracket with  "&gt;" and in between these two we can write name of our tag.</p>
    <p> so this is our paragraph tag &lt; p &gt;</p>
    &copy; this sign make the symbol of copyright.
    &nbsp; this gives the extra space wherever we needed in our code the more number of times we write this word the more spaces&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we get.
